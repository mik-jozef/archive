# Simulation of game inspired by "Clovece, nezlob se!" (Mensch Ã¤rgere Dich nicht)
# Players move along 'numOfFields' fields, the quickest wins. Unlike in the orig-
# iginal, players start at the same position. No two game pieces can occupy the
# same position, except game pieces of different players at the last four fields.
# If a player lands on other player's game piece, it moves to position zero. Each
# round, all players move one game piece along one to six fields (if they can).
# 
# Variations:
# 1. Number of players: 2 to 4
# 2. Number of fields: 10 to 99
# 3. Strategy: players move random game pieces vs always land on other players'
#    game pieces if they can.
# 
# Measured data: number of rounds til a player wins.
#
# The game is played a hundred times for each setting, that is a total of 54000
# games. You can change this with command line argument. (eg. python index.py 10)
